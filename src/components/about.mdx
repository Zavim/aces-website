## About the ACES Program<br/><br/>

Students will complete group and individual challenges, learning to
control emotions and behaviors that could ultimately hinder their
academic and social progress. <br/><br/>

They are taught how to implement this new-found control to
reach short/long term goals via hands-on, goal oriented, role playing,
critical thinking scenarios and community service.<br/><br/>

The ACES program empowers students to experiment and adopt
behaviors that generate positive results.
