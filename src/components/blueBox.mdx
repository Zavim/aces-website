## Achievement through Community Education & Support (ACES)<br/><br/>

We are a fun-focused high school mentoring program.<br/><br/>

We help 9th-12th grade Lorain High School/Success Academy students
accept and successfully navigate a series of challenges.

The students develop inherent skills to overcome barriers hindering
educational, social, emotional and career growth.<br/><br/>

**Our program runs year-round.**
