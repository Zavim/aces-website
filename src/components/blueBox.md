## Achievement through Community Education & Support (ACES)

We are a fun-focused student mentoring program helping 8th â€“ 12th graders within Lorain County to navigate challenges and barriers detrimental to their academic, social, emotional, and career growth.

Students are supported as needed during, after school, evenings and on weekends. ACES also manages a chat room ensuring we are always available to students.
